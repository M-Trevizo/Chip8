# MiChip-8 Emulator

This is my first project with C++ as well as my first emulator. To use the emulator you must provide a path argument to the Chip-8 file that you would like to run. Currently the emulator does not recognize any keyboard input and does not support the Super Chip-48 instruction set.

## ToDo:
- Get Delay Timer working
- Get Sound Timer working
- Add Keyboard support
